My slice of `127.0.0.1` on the Net...

I'm currently a Consulting Systems Engineer for Cisco Systems, helping Data Center clients in the enterprise segment on their individual and unique journeys to the world of digital transformation...

My interests and hence the origin of this page is around code, analytics, system architecture and of course...data. I have great interest in all things data and hope to convey some of that here.

```
I'll even throw some code from time to time...python, R, java...
```

This is the obvious "work in progress" disclaimer...

# Solving today's challenges as a team

Through communication and education, I strive to help teams born of a Gartner's [bi-modal](http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/bimodal) mode 1 type of world address challenges whilst conveying whats coming with regards to [mode 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_2). We work together to address topics such as devops, containers and software defined and how they are interrelated. 

As a Consulting Systems Engineer for Cisco Systems, helping Data Center clients in the enterprise segment navigate their individual and unique journeys through the world of digital transformation is my passion. The clients I see today face fundamental challenges in today's infrastructure regarding reporting, performance management, capacity planning and modeling, monitoring, energy consumption and operation.

Beyond this the prevalent theme is centered around the rapid pace of change in business requirements associated with data which creates unique challenges that are shared amongst industry peers. **Orchestration, automation and policy** are front and center; system admins and infrastructure architects are swarmed with buzzwords in the cloud era. Guidance through education of what tool fills which need is something that we accomplish as a team. _Not every tool is suited for every job._

# Big Data

As a team, we'll lean heavily on Big Data and what it means for the teams...in almost every regard the challenges faced today--the business pressures--are created as a result of Big Data.  Understanding how Big Data fits in a mode 1 framework will lead to application of a mode 2 thinking...effectively solving challenges together.

```
We'll even throw some code from time to time...python, R, java...
```
Automation, orchestration and policy are predicated on code...exploring this together we'll address how it can help solve the above challenges being faced.  I'm versed in HTML/CSS, Java, Python, R, Bash (#!), Perl, Go, JSON, YML, and numerous others. We can decompose API constructs together or individually towards creating projects that effectively address the challenge at hand.

#Philosophy

Our approach will be simple. As a team we'll start with requirements and architect to panacea. We'll identify stakeholder perspectives and ensure that the solution fullfills those unique requirements. Upon design completion, we'll apply budget and executive sponsorship. Applying budget conotates trade-offs; a requirements-first approach ensures education around potential solution trade-offs. All deltas are agreed upon by the stakeholders to ensure system success. 

# Interests

My interests are around code, analytics, system architecture and big data. Outside of this realm I have interests in amateur astronomy, cooking, hiking, photography and travel. Musically I'm a fan of Led Zeppelin and of Jimmy Page...for the music, the showmanship and maybe even a little of the fun...

I also enjoy presenting and educating clients on this journey together. Whilst each client is unique in thier journey, the methods of navigation are shared amongst peers...
